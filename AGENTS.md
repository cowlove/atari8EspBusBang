# Repository Guidance

## Firmware Smoke Tests

- Prefer `tools/boot.sh` for routine hardware build/flash/boot tests rather than invoking `idf.py flash` directly. It records timestamped serial output under `stash/` along with the Git version and a working-tree diff, providing a useful history of boot behavior.
- This reproducible history is worth the inconvenience that `boot.sh` may leave serial-monitor processes running. After each run, check for stale monitors and terminate them before starting another capture.
- The script snapshots `git diff HEAD` and `git describe`, so the diff includes both staged and unstaged changes to tracked files. Untracked file contents are not included; account for those separately when they matter to a capture.
